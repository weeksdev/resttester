Send web requests via the Http Verbs (get, post, put, delete, etc)\r\n2. Add a body for requests other than get\r\n3. Authorization via NetworkCredential or Basic Authorization\r\n4. Custom headers\r\n5. User-Agent and Content-Type settings\r\n6. Automatic JSON beautify for JSON request bodies\r\n7. Response status code information\r\n8. Custom theming\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nBuilt by @weeksdev. Feel free to use for whatever your purposes.  If you see any issues or would like to add features please feel free to do so and send me a pull request.  I'd like to make this a goto http client for manual testing and I understand each REST implementation is custom and may require additional features not currently in the client.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble?  Send a message or post an issue!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
